            <h3>Grateful Dead Web Application</h3>
            <br>
            <p>I completed this project with my teammate Issac Greenfield as our final project for our Full Stack
                Web Development course at PSU. To view our project, click the Steal Your Face above!
                Initially, we intended to have a fully functional search engine for all Grateful Dead shows. This
                proved to be more work than we realized within the timeframe, so we scaled back to do "Dead of the
                Day". Looking back, I
                think it was the right decision,
                because our app is more streamlined and serves a specific purpose. For this project, we used HTML, CSS,
                Javascript,
                Bootstrap, JQuery, JSON, and Archive.org's search API. The biggest hurdle to this
                project was deciphering the ins and outs of archive.org's search API.
                There is some documentation on how to use it, but it required a lot of trial and error on our
                part.
                Things really started moving when we tested this<a href="https://archive.org/help/json.php"
                    class="linkClass">
                    example</a> they provide. Once we figured out that the JSON link in the script call could be
                called on load, things started
                to come together. </p>
            <p>
                Once the work on the API started showing results, this project became really interesting.
                I also learned how to put a function inside of a script, to dynamically obtain
                the JSON data for the
                current day. Archive.org has an advanced search feature that returns results in multiple
                different
                formats, including
                JSON as an option. Now that we have Dead of the Day completed, it would not be too
                difficult to
                expand to other
                searches. When we had the JSON object, it was fairly straightforward to get all the data we
                needed
                from it. I
                added some logic
                statements for cases when there was no data returned, so it wouldn’t show up as “undefined”
                on the
                site.
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Another hurdle was figuring out how to open a new page when clicking one of the cards. This
                page had
                to be dynamically
                created and contain information from the card. We decided to add the identifier to the
                end of the link. This created a new web page from the show’s identifier
                (Every page on archive.org has a unique identifier that is stored in its JSON file).
                Then, on this page (show.html), we
                obtained the identifier information from the link by splicing it. Once we had this
                information,
                all
                the data could be
                obtained, including total run time, setlist, notes, and an embedded music player. I coded
                the
                embedded music player to show
                three songs at a time with a scroll option, because this worked best for our format. We
                wanted
                the color-changing bears to be visible
                while the show was playing, reminiscent of a visualizer.
            </p>
            <p>
                I tried to get the image file on each card to correspond to one of the show's image files,
                but this
                proved difficult
                because the naming
                is not consistent in the JSON data and the image file is not in the same place in each
                directory. There are lots
                of image files, some
                of them were .png and some were .jpg. If I had more time I could likely figure it out but I
                decided it was fine for
                now to have the same sound file image of a show on each card. Issac found a good sound file
                image
                that is a vector
                and our hover image shows up nicely behind it.


            </p>
            <p>
                Moving forward, I would like to edit the title of each card, because as of now, it is just
                pulling the full title which
                is not too easy to read. The format is: "Grateful Dead Live at Music Hall on 1976-06-11."
                The
                good news is,
                all of the titles are formatted the same way, so splicing the desired info would not be
                difficult. Additionally, there is the issue of repeats. When searching a Grateful Dead show
                on this
                day in history,
                there are lots of repeats due to different recordings (from tapers) as well as different
                sound
                formats of the same show.
                As of now it is pulling every one of these, but in the future I think it would make sense to
                either
                use logic to narrow it down
                to one example only (probably based on rating) or instead, when you click on a card for the
                show it
                would bring you to another page
                with every option for that show to let the user decide.
                <div class="image">
                    <img src="images/GDCard.png" alt="GDcard" style='width:100%'>
                </div>

            </p>

            We narrowly fixed a mistake on the morning of our
            presentation. I checked the
            web page and there were no results! There was a simple mistake in how the date was being
            generated
            that Issac fixed, and
            I’m glad I checked it early that morning.

            Overall Issac and I had a great time making this project. I have to say it's been my
            favorite
            school project thus far.
            Issac and I worked great as a team together, and we are both happy with the results. This is
            actually a web
            app that I will use, and my mom and friends will too!
