            <h2>Dead of the Day - Web Application</h2>
            <div class="index align-left">

                <p>I completed this project with my teammate Issac Greenfield as our final project for our Full
                    Stack
                    Web Development course at PSU. To view our project, click the Steal Your Face above!
                    Initially, we intended to have a fully functional search engine for all Grateful Dead shows.
                    This
                    proved to be more work than we realized within the timeframe, so we scaled back to do "Dead of
                    the
                    Day". Looking back, I
                    think it was the right decision,
                    because our app is more streamlined and serves a specific purpose. For this project, we used
                    HTML, CSS,
                    Javascript,
                    Bootstrap, JQuery, JSON, and Archive.org's search API. The biggest hurdle to this
                    project was deciphering the ins and outs of archive.org's search API.
                    There is some documentation on how to use it, but it required a lot of trial and error on our
                    part. Once we figured out that the JSON link in the script call could be
                    called on load, things started
                    to come together. </p>
                <p>
                    Once the work on the API started showing results, this project became really interesting.
                    I also learned how to put a function inside of a script, to dynamically obtain
                    the JSON data for the
                    current day. Archive.org has an advanced search feature that returns results in multiple
                    different
                    formats, including
                    JSON as an option. Now that we have Dead of the Day completed, it would not be too
                    difficult to
                    expand to other
                    searches. When we had the JSON object, it was fairly straightforward to get all the data we
                    needed
                    from it. I
                    added some logic
                    statements for cases when there was no data returned, so it wouldn’t show up as “undefined”
                    on the
                    site.

                <p>
                    Another hurdle was figuring out how to open a new page when clicking one of the cards. This
                    page had
                    to be dynamically
                    created and contain information from the card. We decided to add the identifier to the
                    end of the link. This created a new web page from the show’s identifier
                    (Every page on archive.org has a unique identifier that is stored in its JSON file).
                    Then, on this page (show.html), we
                    obtained the identifier information from the link by splicing it. Once we had this
                    information,
                    all
                    the data could be
                    obtained, including total run time, setlist, notes, and an embedded music player. I coded
                    the
                    embedded music player to show
                    three songs at a time with a scroll option, because this worked best for our format. We
                    wanted
                    the color-changing bears to be visible
                    while the show was playing, reminiscent of a visualizer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I tried to get the image file on each card to correspond to one of the show's image files,
                    but this
                    proved difficult
                    because the naming
                    is not consistent in the JSON data and the image file is not in the same place in each
                    directory. There are lots
                    of image files, some
                    of them were .png and some were .jpg. If I had more time I could likely figure it out but I
                    decided it was fine for
                    now to have the same sound file image of a show on each card. Issac found a good sound file
                    image
                    that is a vector
                    and our hover image shows up nicely behind it.


                </p>
                <p>
                    Moving forward, I would like to edit the title of each card, because as of now, it is just
                    pulling the full title which
                    is not too easy to read. The format is: "Grateful Dead Live at Music Hall on 1976-06-11."
                    The
                    good news is,
                    all of the titles are formatted the same way, so splicing the desired info would not be
                    difficult. Additionally, there is the issue of repeats. When searching a Grateful Dead show
                    on this
                    day in history,
                    there are lots of repeats due to different recordings (from tapers) as well as different
                    sound
                    formats of the same show.
                    As of now it is pulling every one of these, but in the future I think it would make sense to
                    either
                    use logic to narrow it down
                    to one example only (probably based on rating) or instead, when you click on a card for the
                    show it
                    would bring you to another page
                    with every option for that show to let the user decide.

                </p>
                We narrowly fixed a mistake on the morning of our
                presentation. I checked the
                web page and there were no results! There was a simple mistake in how the date was being
                generated
                that Issac fixed, and
                I’m glad I checked it early that morning.

                Overall Issac and I had a great time making this project. I have to say it's been my
                favorite
                school project thus far.
                Issac and I worked great as a team together, and we are both happy with the results. This is
                actually a web
                app that I will use, and my mom and friends will too!
